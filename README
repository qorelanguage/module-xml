Qore xml module

INTRODUCTION
------------
The Qore xml module provides XML functionality to Qore.  This was previously
part of the main qore library but moved to this module in qore v0.8.1

see docs for more information


LICENSE
-------
The source code is released under the LGPL 2.1 and MIT licenses; either license
may be used at the user's discretion.  Note that both licenses are treated
equally by the Qore library in the sense that both licenses allow the module
to be loaded without restrictions by the Qore library (even when the Qore
library is initialized in GPL mode).
See COPYING.MIT and COPYING.LGPL for details on the open-source licenses.


BUILDING
--------
Requires qore 0.8.3+, libxml2 2.6.0+ (http://www.xmlsoft.org), and openssl
headers and libraries to build and run

to configure the build, execute
   	configure --disable-debug

if the qore library cannot be found, then you can use:
   	configure --disable-debug --with-qore=<dir>

if libxml2 cannot be found, then you can use:
   	configure --disable-debug --with-libxml2-dir=<dir>

if openssl cannot be found, then you can use:
	configure --disable-debug --with-openssl-dir=<dir>

The qore binary also needs to be in the path so configure can determine the
module directory

Then execute

make && make install

(or 'make && sudo make install' as needed)

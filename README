Qore xml module

INTRODUCTION
------------
The Qore xml module provides XML functionality to Qore.  This was previously
part of the main qore library but removed in qore v0.8.1

see docs for more information


BUILDING
--------
Requires qore 0.8.1+ and libxml2 to build and run

to configure the build, execute
   	configure --disable-debug

if the qore library cannot be found, then you can use:
   	configure --disable-debug --with-qore=<dir>

if libxml2 cannot be found, then you can use:
   	configure --disable-debug --with-libxml2=<dir>

The qore binary also needs to be in the path so configure can determine the module directory

Then execute

make && make install

(or 'make && sudo make install' as needed)

  + elements with the same names in different namespaces are now handled
    correctly
  + complexTypes wtih a sequence of choice and element elements are now handled
    correctly
  + allow for XSD imports without a URI scheme to be imported with custom logic
  + perform environment-variable substitution on the file path in
    WSDLLib::getWSDL()
  + better support for empty elements; correct de/serialization depending on
    element and type properties
  + allow for XSD imports without a URI scheme to be imported with custom logic
  + allow for schema definitions to temporarily override namespace prefixes
    within that schema

    the response message

* user modules moved to top-level qore module directory from version-specific
  module directory since they are valid for multiple versions of qore
